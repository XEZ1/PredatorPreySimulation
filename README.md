# Predator/Prey Simulation

**Project Background:**

This project represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer, undertaken a long ago during my first year of pursuing a Computer Science degree at King's College London. The inspiration to create a captivating predator/prey simulation emerged from a desire to apply my burgeoning programming skills to a complex, real-world scenario.

**Project Overview:**

The aim of this project was to design and implement an engaging predator/prey simulation entirely from scratch. Drawing inspiration from ecological dynamics and animal behavior, I sought to create an immersive simulation that showcases the interactions and dependencies between different species within a dynamic ecosystem.

## Key Features:

**Species Diversity**: In pursuit of realism and complexity, I meticulously crafted an ecosystem that houses a diverse array of species. These species were thoughtfully designed to include both predators and non-predators, each exhibiting distinct behaviors and characteristics.

**Intricate Interactions**:To mimic the complexity of natural habitats, I introduced intricate interactions among species. Predators were programmed to compete for common food sources, resulting in dynamic and unpredictable ecosystem dynamics.

**Gender Dynamics**: A unique aspect of this simulation was the introduction of gender dynamics. Species were defined as having distinct male and female individuals. Reproduction was made possible only when compatible genders met within a specific proximity, and fine-tuning breeding probabilities became essential for maintaining stable populations.

**Time-Dependent Behaviors**: Emulating the behavior of real-world creatures, species within the simulation were programmed to exhibit different behaviors at different times of the day. This added an extra layer of depth to the simulation, with some species resting during the night and others actively foraging during the day.

**Innovative Challenges**: In addition to the base simulation, I took on several challenge tasks to push the boundaries of realism and complexity:

**Dynamic Plant Growth**: I introduced a dynamic plant growth mechanism to the ecosystem. Plants were now a crucial food source for specific species, and the failure to find sustenance resulted in dire consequences for dependent species.

**Weather Effects**: Weather conditions were incorporated into the simulation, affecting species behaviors. Rain, for example, promoted plant growth, while fog hampered predator visibility, mirroring the real-world impact of weather on ecosystems.

**Disease Transmission**: To emulate real-world complexities, I introduced the concept of diseases. Certain species were susceptible to infections, and these infections could spread to other animals upon contact.
